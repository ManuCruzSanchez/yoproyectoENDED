# yoproyecto

This project is about me, with different sections:

## Intro

Here I introduce myself and explain the reason for the page. You can see the title of the sections or a button that you can click to go directly to the section you want to see, and a picture of me together with a formulary about it. After this introduction, you will find the sections.

## Why here?

I briefly tell how I ended up studying computer science and my experience in it, changing the typography depending on whether I talk about the past or the present.

## Likes ando hobbies

I talk about the things I like and enjoy doing. Apart from the text that summarises it, it has a button that shows a gallery of images about specific things, all with a hover containing a brief explanation of what it is and why I like it. If you are on mobile, the gallery will take up the whole screen.
You can exit it with the button at the bottom of the gallery.

## Future

I take a brief look back at what has happened in my life recently. Things that I feel have made me change so much in such a short time.
Good and bad experiences, all necessary to make me who I am now, and now waiting for the new ones that will make me the person I will be in the future.

### Footer

Apart from these sections, there is also the header (which I name in the introduction) and the footer, where you usually leave your social networks and other information. But lacking these I decided to put two things:
My youtube channel, where I make silly videos (not very often) that I enjoy making.
My brother's Instagram, who encouraged me to exercise, and thanks to him I feel happy with my body.
